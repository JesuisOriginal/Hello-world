# Machine Learning

Java collection that provides Java packages for developing a machine learning algorithm and that is
- easy to use -> great for small projects or just to learn how machine learning works
- small and simple -> easy to understand and making changes
- lightweight (mostly because I'm a student who just started to learn how to code Java and can't code more complex :P)

## Code Example

### [Neural Network](src/main/java/neural)

If you have some test data consisting of inputs and outputs.
(Be sure that your data is normalized if needed!)

```
double[][] train_input = new double[][] {
        {1, 2},
        {3, 4},
        {5, 6}};
double[][] train_output = new double[][] {
        {0.1},
        {0.2},
        {0.3}};
```

Initialize a new network with a given architecture (number or inputs, number of hidden layers their number of neurons and their activation function, number of outputs)
(If you don't know what to choose, here is a rule of thumb for a quadratic looking network: 
- number of hidden layers = number of inputs
- number of neurons per layer: number of inputs (except the last layer is the output layer = as many neurons as outputs)
- activation functions: hyperbolic tangent)

```
Network net = new Network(
		2,
        new int[]{2, 1},
        new int[]{Layer.ACTIVATION_TANH, Layer.ACTIVATION_TANH});
```

Then you can seed the weights in the network = randomize it.

```
net.seedWeights(-1, 1);
```

Now your network is ready for training!
Just feed it how often it should go through the whole network, how big the weight change to calculate the error gradient should be, the learning rate that gets applied to the weights, the lower and upper bounds for the weights, and of course it also needs the training data.
* loops: more = better result but takes longer
* epsilon: smaller = more precise gradient but could fail as the gradient approaches 0
* learning rate: higher = faster training but to high could miss the optimum (decomment the Exception in the train function to check for an increasing error

```
net.train(100, 0.00001, 0.5, -1, 1, train_input, train_output);
```

If you would like to see the progress, decomment this line in the train method:

```
//      //For debugging: output the progress
//      System.out.println(100.0*k/loops + "%: " + costs[k]);
```

Now the network should be trained so let's have a look at the network itself by simply printing a basic representation and try a new input to make a prediction.

```
System.out.println(net);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(net.calculate(new double[] {7, 8})));
```

And if we would like to get the mean squared error we just call the cost function on some new test data:

```
net.cost(train_input, train_output);
```

## Installation

I included all packages with the source files in the [Source folder /src](src).
Just add them to your project and you are ready to go!

## Tests

In every Java class should be a main method that shows how to use this specific class.
